# CMPT276_TheBestGroupProject
This project aims to establish a website that will serve educational and supportive purposes. This platform is meant to provide a safe space for women and families who have gone through domestic violence or other traumas, facilitating access to essential resources, courses, and community support. 

This will have a Donate link, a facebook UI for updates on current events going on for these courses, a place for course signup and unregistering, an about us page, a resource page, and a login section to keep your progress
